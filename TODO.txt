 TailTapped sending cards to empty piles with K accept in Clondike
ERROR: PileDrawCenteredGlyph: Symbol font not loaded when loading same card design twice
(the whole card things is broken anyway - no one likes retro, unicode can't be flipped, and they don't scale)
 PileMoveCards() should return void, all undo pushed managed by CRC
 Use gosol method of doing accept (label)
 retire retro cards

x CardTapped should be TailTapped
x Klondike not using new TailTapped
